Operator-led market entry and execution frameworks for Germany / DACH.

I work with founders, CEOs, and leadership teams who already have traction —
and need their market entry or business unit execution to actually work.

This GitHub profile contains **execution-first frameworks** based on real operating experience,
not theory or consulting models.

## Focus Areas

- Market entry into Germany / DACH
- Ownership & decision architecture
- First 90 days execution systems
- Business unit & country launch readiness
- Execution breakdown prevention

Principle:
**Ownership before strategy.  
Structure before scale.  
Execution before optimisation.**

## How to use this content

These frameworks are intentionally:
- practical
- opinionated
- execution-focused

They are designed to:
- diagnose failure points early
- create clarity of ownership
- prevent slow, silent market entry collapse

No community support, issues, or discussions are provided.

## Background

I have built and led market entry and execution setups from inside the organisation.
This repository reflects what actually breaks — and what holds — in real operating environments.
